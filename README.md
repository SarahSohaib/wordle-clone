#Wordle Clone

A minimalist Wordle-inspired web app, built using **Flask** on the backend and **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** on the frontend.

This version lets players pick a category before each game and challenges them to guess a 5-letter word with feedback after every attempt. A virtual keyboard and color-coded hints enhance the gameplay. Still a work in progress.
